# Movie Management System (SQL Project)

This repository contains a database project titled **Movie Management System**, designed using core **DBMS concepts** and implemented in **SQL**. It includes the database schema, sample data, and query scripts to manage a collection of movies, their genres, directors, actors, and reviews.

## 📘 Project Overview

The Movie Management System allows structured storage and retrieval of movie-related data. This system demonstrates normalization, relational integrity, and practical SQL operations including:

- Creating and managing multiple related tables
- Inserting, updating, and deleting records
- Querying data using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and aggregate functions
- Ensuring referential integrity with foreign keys

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

## 🧱 Database Tables

- `movies`: stores basic movie info (title, release year, genre, etc.)
- `directors`: contains director details
- `actors`: contains actor details
- `movie_cast`: links actors with movies and roles
- `genres`: defines movie genres
- `reviews`: user reviews and ratings for each movie

## 📌 Features Demonstrated

- **Relational schema design**
- **Data normalization**
- **SQL joins and subqueries**
- **Aggregate functions**
- **Foreign key constraints**

## 📚 Learning Objectives

This project showcases practical applications of:

- Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling
- SQL DDL & DML commands
- Relational integrity and normalization
- Query optimization concepts

## ✅ Requirements

- Basic understanding of SQL
- MySQL or compatible SQL server
- SQL client or IDE (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, pgAdmin)
